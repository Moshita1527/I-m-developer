        <h2>Woven in Code</h2>
            <p>It all started in the quiet glow of midnight, I opened a blank browser tab—a window to everywhere and nowhere.
            Whispers of code unfolded: angle brackets and curly braces, symbols that felt like secret runes.
            I traced them with hesitant keystrokes, each <html> a soft heartbeat echoed, each <body> a breath taken, and a world began to unfurl. And in the silence, a dream took shape, line by line, pulse by pulse.

        <h2>How my digital dreams awaken</h2>
            <p>Days blurred like cascading style sheets.
            Colors obeyed, layouts aligned, and the once-silent page hummed beneath my fingertips.
            JavaScript flickered alive—tiny sparks of logic that made buttons dance and words respond, as if the screen finally recognized me. Thats when i realised, am born for this!</p>

        <h2>Debugging the awaken path</h2>
            <p>Suddenly, errors!, it came like sudden storms: red text, cryptic warnings.
            Yet each failure was a compass, pointing toward understanding.
            I learned to listen—to servers echoing across invisible wires, to protocols speaking in 200s and 404s, and in the silence between errors, i found my own voice.
            </p>
        <h2>The constellation of the Dreams</h2>
            <P>By the month’s end, a small constellation of projects floated on the web:
            a personal space stitched from tags and dreams, accessible to anyone, anywhere.
            What began as a blank tab had become a living map of my persistence.Its stars shining brighter with every click, every line of code forever etched in the digital sky.
            </P>
            
            <p>A quiet proof that you can weave worlds from nothing <br />
               but thought, patience, and code One line at a time <br />
                forever</p>
